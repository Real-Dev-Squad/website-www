## Live site feature

### Overview

The goal of live site feature is to enable users to share their screens during these sessions, enhancing the ability to collaborate and showcase their skills to potential employers and other developers.

The aim is to create a feature that allows for seamless screen sharing and allows users who join the session late to quickly catch up on what has been discussed with the help of additional features like meeting notes, chat, word cloud, and more. This will make it easier for participants to stay engaged and informed, as well as attract new users who are browsing or curious about RDS.

The sessions should be open to all users from various platforms like Twitter, enabling other learners, job seekers as well as potential hiring managers to join and participate.

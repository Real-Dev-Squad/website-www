## CSS Structure

### Global CSS

- `main.css`
  - This css file will contain common css pertaining to all pages that can be used throughout the website.
  - For example, a class with name success, when used anywhere throughout the website will make the color of the text green.

### Page specific CSS

- For example, events page css goes inside `events.css`.
- Also, in future if we add new components, we will keep component specific css like `navbar.css`, `footer.css`, `header.css` etc.
- For mobile responsive css, we can have a folder with multiple css files catering to different css pertaining to different resolutions.

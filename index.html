            <p>
              Real Dev Squad is an online non-profit open source free fun
              community for people in tech, mainly developers, designers,
              college students, or product managers, to come, learn and
              contribute towards building a platform for our community, that
              helps upskill everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are an inclusive, respectful, warm, motivated and commited
              squad of people who constantly grow together and tackle bigger and
              harder challenges to ensure we become some of the best problem
              solvers, engineers, designers and more out there.

                <div>
                  <p>
                    It’s in the name. We do real development to solve real
                    challenges. This isn’t a tutorial hell workshop, where you
                    constantly watch a bunch of videos all the time and label
                    yourself a developer on LinkedIn.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We don’t do unfinished hobby projects here. Our code is peer
                    reviewed, improved and the open source work that you do here
                    is displayed on your member’s profile.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You are encouraged to show this profile to your potential
                    recruiters, and this work is more credible because it’s
                    deployed on production and has real users. You will learn
                    debugging skills and improving performance and reliability
                    of the products you make here.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You will be given real challenges, which are always slightly
                    outside your comfort zone and current skills, so that you
                    keep getting better.

                  Constant coaching and mentoring

                  <p>
                    Our main mentor and coach, <b>Ankush Dharkar</b>, has been
                    teaching people to solve engineering challenges and code for
                    a long time. He is himself a full-stack developer, with
                    heavy expertise on Frontend UI engineering. He was involved
                    with his own startup for more than 7 years, then worked at
                    Disney+Hotstar, was an instructor at career accelerator at
                    Pesto Tech, and currently working at Amazon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You will always be tracked for updates on our
                    <b>status site</b>, and we periodically remove our inactive
                    participants. So, rest assured, there’s no dead-weight.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You will always have direction and goals on how to improve.
                    You won’t be wasting time deciding what to build -- this is
                    often a problem people don’t realize. People choose hobby
                    projects they already know how to do. In real life, quite
                    often you get new unforseen challenges. We prepare you to
                    tackle them head-on.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>
                    You will work with other smart developers, some of them who
                    started with almost no knowledge of coding or development.
                    The only thing that makes them successful is commitment,
                    persistence and willingness to admit things they do not know
                    and do something about it. If you stay shy and don’t
                    participate, you will be the one at loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All the members who you would work with, our highly active
                    motivated and driven peer group that you can ask for. You
                    may or may not have such a group at your workplace :)

                <div>
                  <p>
                    We share our experiences and knowledge, so you will learn
                    far more and sooner than on your own. We pool and share our
                    resources to ensure we are some of the best employees
                    companies will come across.

                  <p>
                    We are not a one-trick pony. We do projects in a lot of
                    technologies, including standard web technologies like HTML,
                    CSS, JavaScript, React, Ember, Vue, Node, Go, Rust, and
                    more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We don’t limit ourselves to one thing. We focus on building
                    amazing basic foundations and then adapting and learning
                    whatever tech or tool we have to in order to engineer the
                    best solutions to problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are engineers and problem solvers, not the kind of people
                    who will become outdated with time.

                    Being successful in career is much more than just knowing
                    how to push keys and click around. We ensure that you are
                    the kind of person who is great at communitcation skills:
                    Both Written and Spoken.

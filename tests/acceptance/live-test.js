      Line 30 has been commented as currently the click serves no meaning, as the test is incomplete and
      the button click fires a network call which causes test to fail

      Currently the when the button is clicked it makes a api call, which fails after some time
      When a promise was fired by this test, but this test don't wait for it to get resolved before this test is torn down,
      So later when the promise is resolved/rejected there no reference to the tests which had fired the event, so it gives error

      **ERROR message
        global failure: Error: Cannot call `.lookup` after the owner has been destroyed@ 30 ms

      This can be solved by waiting for the promise to get resolved before the test is torn down
